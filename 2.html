    <h2>E - sports는 왜 스포츠로 인정되어야 하는가?</h2> 
    <p>In my opinion, we need to  accept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports" target="_blank" title="
        E- sprots definition">E - sports</a> as an olympic sport. First fo all, E - sports has many 
        fans. According to the Korean broadcasting station, when they opened the final game of 2016 LOL world
        championship, <u>200,000,000</u> people watched it at the same time. This number is bigger than the 
        NBA final game's audience number. Also, accroding to a Korean E - sports association report, an opening 
        had 300,000,000 people watching on average. That means, sports that are regesitered as the olympic. the
        olympic sports have to have a lot of fans. I think this number is enough to make them acceptable. The 
        second reason is economic effect. Some of economic experts are expecting that E - sports market's economic
        effect will be $1.76 billion.
